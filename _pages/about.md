I have been a consultant to Foxconn Health Technology Business Group and my role is to lead the robotics team in the development of robotic services in the medical field. In the period, I developed a business strategy, human resource planning, and technical training.

Before that, I have experience in the development, equipment standard, and certification of wearable medical equipment at the National Taiwan University College of Medicine.

I have had an entrepreneurial experience for a few years, my role is to lead the R&D team to develop medical devices and service robots for new business development, and I am representative of Accurate Meditech, one of the technology innovation teams that formed a syndicate under Taiwan’s own pavilion at CES 2019 and be received by Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen.
