I am currently seeking a Ph.D. position in the field of brain-computer interface for the Fall of 2024 or 2025. Between 2021 and 2023, I have published over ten original articles in SCI journals, with ten being either first-authored or corresponding-authored. My research focuses on biomedical signal processing and sensor design.

While at Foxconn Health Technology Business Group, I served as a consultant. I held a pivotal role as the robotics team leader responsible for developing robotic services in the medical field. I spearheaded various initiatives throughout this period, including devising a comprehensive business strategy, overseeing human resource planning, and conducting technical training.

After leaving Foxconn Technology Group, my partners and I founded several startup companies. One representative company was a medical device startup focused on developing cuffless technology. [During my tenure as R&D director, my team successfully obtained  **FDA's 510(k) approval** for our product, the **first over-the-counter cuffless wearable device**  to receive such approval.](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfpmn/pmn.cfm?ID=K222658) Furthermore, my team is one of the technology innovation teams representing Taiwan's pavilion at CES 2019. We were honored to be received by President Tsai Ing-wen and collectively secured approximately NTD $5.5 billion in business opportunities. Our achievements garnered significant international media attention, surpassing our exposure from the previous year.

Finally, my programming experience has been more than 10+ years and focus on Robotics, Computer Vision, Signal Processing, and Embedded Systems.
I have had an entrepreneurial experience for a few years, my role is to lead the R&D team to develop medical devices and service robots for new business development, and I am representative of Accurate Meditech, one of the technology innovation teams that formed a syndicate under Taiwan’s own pavilion at CES 2019 and be received by Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen. The teams together secured around NTD $5.5 billion in business opportunities and gained even more exposure in international media than last year.
