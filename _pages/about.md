I am currently seeking a Ph.D. position in the field of brain-computer interface for the Fall of 2024 or 2025. Between 2021 and 2023, I have published over ten original articles in SCI journals, with ten being either first-authored or corresponding-authored. My research focuses on biomedical signal processing and sensor design.

While at Foxconn Health Technology Business Group, I served as a consultant. I held a pivotal role as the robotics team leader responsible for developing robotic services in the medical field. I spearheaded various initiatives throughout this period, including devising a comprehensive business strategy, overseeing human resource planning, and conducting technical training.

I have had an entrepreneurial experience for a few years, my role is to lead the R&D team to develop medical devices and service robots for new business development, and I am representative of Accurate Meditech, one of the technology innovation teams that formed a syndicate under Taiwan’s own pavilion at CES 2019 and be received by Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen. The teams together secured around NTD $5.5 billion in business opportunities and gained even more exposure in international media than last year. [the president **Tsai Ing-wen** met with national representatives from CES 2019 at the Presidential Office](https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3646420).
