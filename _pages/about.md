I am seeking a Ph.D. position in **neuroscience** or **brain-computer interface(BCI)** for Fall 2024 or 2025. Between 2021 and 2023, I have published over ten original articles in SCI journals, with ten being either first-authored or corresponding-authored. My research focuses on biomedical signal processing and sensor design.

While at Foxconn Health Technology Business Group, I served as a consultant. I was the robotics team leader responsible for developing robotic services in the medical field. I spearheaded various initiatives throughout this period, including devising a comprehensive business strategy, overseeing human resource planning, and conducting technical training.

After leaving Foxconn Technology Group, my partners and I founded several startup companies. One representative company was a medical device startup focused on developing cuffless technology. During my tenure as R&D director, my team successfully obtained  [**FDA's 510(k) approval**](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfpmn/pmn.cfm?ID=K222658)  for our product, **the first over-the-counter(OTC) cuffless wearable device** to receive such approval. Furthermore, my team is one of the technology innovation teams representing Taiwan's pavilion at CES 2019. We were honored to be received by **President Tsai Ing-wen** and collectively secured approximately NTD $5.5 billion in business opportunities. Our achievements garnered significant international media attention, surpassing our exposure from the previous year.
