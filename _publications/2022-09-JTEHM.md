This study proposes a low-cost, high-sensitivity sensor of beat-to-beat local pulse wave velocity (PWV), to be used in a cuffless blood pressure monitor (BPM). Objective: We design an adaptive algorithm to detect the feature of the pulse wave, making it possible for two sensors to measure the local PWV in the radial artery at a short distance. Unlike the cuffless BPM that needs to use a regression model for calibration. Method: We encapsulate the piezoelectric sensor material in a cavity and design an analog front-end circuit. This study used color ultrasound imaging equipment to measure radial arterial parameters, including the diameter and wall thickness, to aid the estimation of blood pressure (BP) using the Moens-Korteweg (MK) equation of hemodynamics. Results: We compared the blood pressure estimated by the MK equation with the reference BP measured using an aneroid sphygmomanometer in a test group of 32 people, resulting in a mean difference of systolic BP of −0.63 mmHg, and a standard deviation of ±5.14 mmHg, a mean difference of mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 0.97 mmHg, with a standard deviation of ±3.54 mmHg, and a mean difference of diastolic BP of −1.14 mmHg, with a standard deviation of ±4.08 mmHg. This study has verified its compliance with ISO 81060-2. Conclusions: A new type of wearable continuous calibration-free BPM can replace the situation that requires the use of traditional ambulatory BPM and reduce patient discomfort. Clinical impact: In this study can provide long-term continuous blood pressure monitoring in the hospital.
