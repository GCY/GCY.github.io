title: "Human Posture Recognition Based on Neural Network in Robot Controlling"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2013-04-undergraduate-research
excerpt: 'We study the possibility of controlling the robot using a natural user interface(NUI) and human posture recognition based on a neural network. Our humanoid robot platform is BeRobot; BeRobot is 16 degree of freedom(DOF) humanoid robot. We use the Microsoft Kinect received skeleton, then calculate the vector dot product of the keypoint, input the vector dot product to our posture recognition neural network(Fully Connected), output pre-define human posture, and finally, transmit the posture to the robot through Bluetooth to control.
