The structure used in this study is as follows: substrate/PMMA/ZnS/Ag/MoO3/NPB/Alq3/LiF/Al. Here, PMMA serves as the surface flattening layer, ZnS/Ag/MoO3 as the anode, NPB as the hole injection layer, Alq3 as the emitting layer, LiF as the electron injection layer, and aluminum as the cathode. The properties of the devices with different substrates were investigated using P4 and glass, developed in the laboratory, as well as commercially available PET. After film formation, P4 creates holes on the surface. The light field distribution of the device was calculated at wavelengths of 480 nm, 550 nm, and 620 nm using optical simulation. It was found that this microstructure contributes to light extraction. The maximum brightness, external quantum efficiency, and current efficiency of the device at a P4 thickness of 2.6 μm were 72,500 cd/m2, 1.69%, and 5.68 cd/A, respectively. However, the maximum brightness of the same structure with PET (130 μm) was 9500 cd/m2. The microstructure of the P4 substrate was found to contribute to the excellent device performance through analysis of the AFM surface morphology, film resistance, and optical simulation results. The holes formed by the P4 substrate were created solely by spin-coating the material and then placing it on a heating plate to dry, without any special processing. To confirm the reproducibility of the naturally formed holes, devices were fabricated again with three different emitting layer thicknesses. The maximum brightness, external quantum efficiency, and current efficiency of the device at an Alq3 thickness of 55 nm were 93,400 cd/m2, 1.7%, and 5.6 cd/A, respectively.

Keywords: copolymer, flexible substrate, organic light emitting diode, fluorescent material, thermal stability.
