This paper proposes an effective approach to distinguish whether samples include Human Papilloma virus type-16 (HPV16) by Atomic force microscopy (AFM). AFM is an important instrument in nanobiotechnology field. At first we identified the HPV16 by Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis and Western blotting from specimen of the HPV patient (E12) and the normal (C2), and then we used an AFM to observe the surface ultrastructure by tapping mode and to measure the unbinding force between HPV16 coupled to an AFM tip and anti-HPV16 L1 coated on the substrate surface by contact mode. The experimental results by tapping mode show that the size of a single HPV viron was similar to its SEM image from the previous literatures; moreover, based on the purposed methods and the analysis, two obvious findings that we can determine whether or not the subject is a HPV patient can be derived from the results; one is based on the distribution of unbinding forces, and the other is based on the distribution of the stiffness. Furthermore, the proposed method could be a useful technique for further investigating the potential role among subtypes of HPVs in the oncogenesis of human cervical cancer.
