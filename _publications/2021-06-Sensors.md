In this study, we designed a dentary bone conduction system that transmits and receives audio by laser. The main objective of this research was to propose a complete hardware design method, including a laser audio transmitter and receiver and digital signal processor (DSP) based digital signal processing system. We also present a digital filter algorithm that can run on a DSP in real time. This experiment used the CMU ARCTIC databasesâ€™ human-voice reading audio as the standard audio. We used a piezoelectric sensor to measure the vibration signal of the bone conduction transducer (BCT) and separately calculated the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the digitally filtered audio output and the unfiltered audio output using DSP. The SNR of the former was twice that of the latter, and the BCT output quality significantly improved. From the results, we can conclude that the dentary bone conduction system integrated with a DSP digital filter enhances sound quality.

Keywords: DSP-based, CMU ARCTIC databases, DSP digital filter.
