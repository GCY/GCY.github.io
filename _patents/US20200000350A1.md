title: "Dynamic measurement device with a blood pressure determination function"
collection: patents
permalink: /patents/US20200000350A1
excerpt: 'The present invention provides a dynamic measurement device with a blood pressure determination function, comprising: a heartbeat sensing module disposed on the chest area of a user wherein the heartbeat sensing module comprising a heart sound sensor for obtaining heartbeat signals; a pulse sensing module disposed on a limb area of the user, the pulse sensing module comprising a pulse wave sensor for obtaining pulse signals; and a data calculating module for calculating a mean arterial pressure and a value of systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure based on the heartbeat signals and pulse signals. In addition to dynamically monitoring the blood pressure of a user for 24 hours, the present invention can dynamically monitor the heart sounds of the user for 24 hours individually in order to monitor userâ€™s physical condition. Therefore, the present invention has important medical meanings.'
