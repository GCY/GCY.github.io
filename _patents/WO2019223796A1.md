title: "A device for measuring blood pressure"
collection: patents
permalink: /patents/WO2019223796A1
excerpt: 'A wearable device (100) for measuring blood pressure comprises a housing (195) with through-holes formed thereon, a processing unit (120) disposed in the housing (195), a display (160) connected to the processing unit (120), a plurality of sensors (110) connected to the processing unit (120), the sensors (110) being configured to transmit at least one physiological signal to the processing unit (120) via the through-holes, and a time delay structure connected between one of the through-holes and one of the sensors (110) and configured to lengthen a path distance between the skin surface and the sensor (110), wherein the processing unit (120) is configured to determine a systolic arterial pressure and a diastolic arterial pressure by the at least one physiological signal and a Moens-Korteweg (MK) function, and to control the display (160) to display the systolic arterial pressure and the diastolic arterial pressure to be read by the user.'
